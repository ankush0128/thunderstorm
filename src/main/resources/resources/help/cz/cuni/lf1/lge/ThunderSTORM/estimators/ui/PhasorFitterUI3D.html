<h2>Phasor</h2>

<div class="p">
The phasor algorithm is a simple, model-free and non-iterative localization
algorithm, described in [1]. It is based on the principle that
the first Fourier coefficient of a Fourier transform of a 1D or 2D
image will provide information about the major constituent in the
image. In case of single molecule localization, the major constituent
is the PSF of an emitter. The first Fourier coefficient will directly provide
information about the position and the FWHM of the PSF in the
horizontal and vertical directions. As phasor localization is a model-free
localization algorithm, it performs much faster than traditional Gaussian-based
methods, with equal localization accuracies in all dimensions.

<div class="p">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p">
Phasor localization perfoms best at relatively small
ROI sizes compared to gaussian-based models. It is recommended to use a radius of  300nm (a
total ROI size of 700x700nm). Astigmatic localization could
benefit from slightly larger sub-image size if high signal-to-noise
levels are achieved. The small ROI sizes are caused
by the fact that the presence of high amounts of background
in the ROI introduces errors in the phasor localization.

<div class="p">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="p">
As phasor localization provides information about the width of the
PSF in X and Y, it can be used for astigmatic 3D positioning. This
requires a calibration curve (see <a href="../estimators/ui/CalibrationEstimatorUI.html">Calibration of the imaging system</a>).
<b>Be aware that the calibration curve is dependent on the size
of the sub-image chosen for phasor! </b>Use the same sub-image size for
calibration and localization. As the ratio of the phasor magnitude is
consistent amongst background levels, the calibration series can have
a different background-to-noise ratio than the actual measurement.

The basic principle behind the technique consists of the following
steps:

<ol type="1">
<li> From the ROI around an approximate localization, perform a partial Fourier transformation and isolate
the first Fourier coefficient in both X and Y direction.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Plot the real and imaginary parts of the 2 coefficients in a phasor diagram
- a 2D plotting tool with real and imaginary axis.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Calculate the phase angles corresponding to the 2 coefficients. This
is a direct value for the normalized position of the emitter in the
ROI.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Calculate the phasor magnitudes. This is a value for the
PSF width in X and Y.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li> Calculate the Z-position based on two defocus curves
as described in [1,2], if applicable.
